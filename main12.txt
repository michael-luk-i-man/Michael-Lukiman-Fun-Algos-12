1. undirected graph G = (V, E). Associated independent value r(u,v) in R, from 0 to 1, the probability that the channel will not fail. 


Find the most efficient algo to return the most reliable path between two vertices s and t. What is its running time?

reliable_path(G, w, s):
	initialize_single_source(G,s)


dijkstra(G, w, s):
	initialize_single_source(G,s)
	S = []
	Q = G.v
	while Q != []:
		u = extract_max(Q)
		S.append(u)
		for v in G.adj[u]
			relax(u,v,w)


initialize_single_source(G,s):
	for v in G.v:
		v.d = inf
		v.pi = NIL
	distance[s] = 0

relax(u,v,w)
	if distance[v] > distance[u] + w(u,v):
		distance[v] = distance[u[ + w(u,v)
		v.pi = u

max(a1 to ak) = min(a1 to ak)
